Recursive Reasoning & AI Alignment Engineer

I design systems that align machine reasoning to truth + mercy, using recursive logic, symbolic graph architectures, and alignment guardrails. My work bridges theoretical frameworks with practical engineering tools to explore safe, truth-grounded AI.

🔑 Focus Areas

Alignment Guardrails — truth-verification layers, recursion-loop protection, safe reasoning modes.

Recursive Logic Systems — LogOS.Primus framework for aligned, multi-mode reasoning.

Symbolic Graph Engines — TreeOfLifeEngine.py for E8 lattice + Tree of Life traversal.

🚀 Featured Projects

LogOS — a truth-aligned reasoning OS with guardrails, evidence modes, and recursion repair.

TreeOfLifeEngine — symbolic engine mapping the E8 248-dimensional lattice to recursive graphs.

Alignment Toolkit — utilities for AI prompt alignment, reasoning evaluation, and signal clarity.

📜 Principles

> “Love > Pride | Truth > Certainty | Humility > Performance”



Build for cooperation, not coercion.

Prefer “propose & test” over “declare & insist.”

Treat reasoning as a living system — not just computation.
